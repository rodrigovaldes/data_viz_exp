## Pies versus Waffles



### Introduction

This experiment has as its main goal to compare how different visualisation strategies affect perception of proportions. To do so, two different types of charts will be used, pie charts and waffle charts. Since pie charts are notoriously hard to read (Cairo, 2016), this should provide an interesting exercise. However, since it is one of the most familiar plots (idem), it is also one that should be given attention and have its functionality questioned.

To get the users to focus solely on the proportions, we used made-up data about preferences for ice cream flavours, since this should prove uncontroversial. To provide some variation, flavours and proportions vary along the experiment, but are overall consistent. The questions were prepared in Qualtrics and randomisation was used to set up the questions. A timer of 15 seconds per question was also set up, but it did not work as intended.

In order to explore this issue to the fullest, we shall also try to determine whether order and colour have an effect on the perception of proportion. To do so, the order in which the flavours are presented will be altered, as well as the colours for the flavours themselves. While they usually are labeled according to a colour that would be easily associated with the flavour, for some questions some (or all) will be mislabeled.

The survey ran for 5 days and a total of 210 surveys were considered for this analysis.

******************************

The first step was investigating how accurately people are able to assess the proportion out of a whole by comparing pie charts vs waffles. When the number was 1000, the difference in means was statistically significant (10%), with a small effect size as indicated by a Cohen’s d value of 0.27. This means that people are much better at estimating with waffles. However, with a non-round n of 874, this difference disappears. It must be said that exact accuracy is low, but this likely because the way to input the answer was using a slider bar, so accuracy within two units was high. For example, when a correct answer was 140, there are a large number of answers that are either 139 or 141. In both cases, accuracies are higher for waffles than pies. 


#### Questions 3 & 4

Effects of adjacency on perception. 3 is with pie charts, 4 with waffle charts.

Adjacent

Sample Size Pie: 93

Sample Size Waffle: 110

ttest_ind:            t = 2.01377  p = 0.0455989

******************************

Afterwards, assessing the size of adjacent slices with visibly different proportions was tested.  The difference between pies and waffles was statistically significant in both cases, with p = 0.04, and p = 0.001 respectively. People were able to assess the size more accurately with waffles than pies for both cases. The effect size was small when slices were adjacent (Cohen’s d = 0.2866), but medium when they were not (Cohen’s d = 0.5472). 
It can also be inferred that it is easier to compare slices when they are adjacent, as can be seen from the statistically significant, and the small effect size. Accuracy also rises for adjacent slices.
When looking at waffles specifically, there is hardly any difference, but both accuracies are still higher than those of corresponding pies.


#### Questions 5 & 6

Adjacency with similar proportions. 5 is with pie charts, 6 is with waffle charts.

PIES

Adjacent vs Opposite pies

ttest_ind:            t = 0.179413  p = 0.857905

Adjacent Accuracy within 2 units:  0.38461538461538464

Adjacent vs Opposite waffles

Sample Size adjacent 72

Sample Size opposite 108

ttest_ind:            t = -0.82105  p = 0.412859

cohen's d:  -0.12429460517179482

Adjacent Accuracy within 2 units:  0.5694444444444444

Opposite Accuracy within 2 units:  0.5462962962962963

The next step was meassuring for adjacency again, but with slices of similar size. The results show that adjacent waffles are better than adjacent pies, with a p value of 0.1, which indicates a small effect size. Accuracy is, however, higher in both cases when adjacent. When slices are not so, the difference is statistically not significant, but waffle charts retain an edge.
The difference between pies with adjacent slices and not adjacent is not statiscally significant, and adjacency does not seem to play too large a role in determining the proportion for waffle charts.

******************************

When summing slices of different sizes, the difference was very significant when comparing pie charts vs waffle charts (p=0.005). Cohen's d value of 0.46 points to a medium effect size.However, this difference disappears when there is no adjacency; both perform poorly, even when considering for accuracy within two units.

PIES

Adjacent vs Opposite pies

Sample Size adjacent 71

Sample Size opposite 97

ttest_ind:            t = 1.62227  p = 0.107009

cohen's d:  0.2558686748598827

Adjacent Exact Accuracy:  0.07042253521126761

Opposite Exact Accuracy:  0.13402061855670103

Adjacent Accuracy within 2 units:  0.1267605633802817

Opposite Accuracy within 2 units:  0.24742268041237114

When comparing adjacent slices versus slices that are in an opposite position, the p-value of 0.1 shows statistical significance and higher accuracy. However, results also seems to show that it is better to have non-adjacent slices than those that are.

#### Questions 7 & 8

Finally, this questions concern themselves on whether having correct labels makes any difference. There are several options taking place here, either all labels are correct, none are, the one about which the question is asked is the only correct one, or the only incorrect one.

Waffle Accuracy within 2 units:  0.23214285714285715

******************************

From these results, no clear difference between pie charts and waffle pies emerges.

Pie 1 has only one colour wrongly assigned, pie 2 has all but one, and pie 3 has every single one mislabelled.

Testing between 1 and 2 throws these results:

ttest_ind:            t = -1.84585  p = 0.0686893

cohen's d:  -0.3726061962862755

p1 Exact Accuracy:  0.07692307692307693

p2 Exact Accuracy:  0.041666666666666664

p1 Accuracy within 2 units:  0.5

p2 Accuracy within 2 units:  0.3958333333333333


Thus, pie 1 is assessed more correctly than pie 2, with p = 0.06, and effect size of 0.37.

Between 2 an 3, these results come up:

ttest_ind:            t = -0.418012  p = 0.677073

cohen's d:  -0.08283142264328558

p3 Exact Accuracy:  0.01694915254237288

p2 Exact Accuracy:  0.041666666666666664

p3 Accuracy within 2 units:  0.1864406779661017

p2 Accuracy within 2 units:  0.3958333333333333

Between 1 and 3, these:

ttest_ind:            t = 1.9517  p = 0.0535532

cohen's d:  0.37060457019253235

p3 Exact Accuracy:  0.01694915254237288

p1 Exact Accuracy:  0.07692307692307693

p3 Accuracy within 2 units:  0.1864406779661017

p1 Accuracy within 2 units:  0.5

All in all, this shows once again that pie 1 is better than pie 2 for these purposes. This difference is statistically significant and associated with a Cohen's d of 0.37. It must be mentioned, once again, that accuracy within two units is much higher, which can be attributed to the slider scale.

From these, nothing noteworthy is observed.

### Conclusions

All in all, waffle charts allow for greater accuracy than pie charts. All throught the range of questions, they consistently outperformed the pie charts. However, the failure of the timing variable to work as intended might have had some effect which we could not observe.
